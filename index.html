		   <p> Though funny, the people interviewed in this video's lack of misinformation is shocking and terrifying. ObamaCare is what many have nicknamed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
		   a set of health insurance and industry reforms passed by Congress and signed by President Obama in March 2010. ObamaCare has significantly increased the number of
		   the people with health insurance coverage. It did this by overhauling the individual insurance market, where individuals buy their own policies, and expanding Medicaid, 
		   a public program that covers low-income Americans. ObamaCare however does more than expand health insurance coverage, it touches nearly every American industry. </p>
		  </div> 
		<br><br><br>
		  <div>
			<h3>What does the Affordable Care Act do? </h3>
			<p>Overall, there are two main things that ObamaCare does: 1) expand access to health insurance and 2) change the way the federal government pays doctors. So far about 24 
			million have become insured since the expansion started in 2014 and left unchanged, the federal budget forecasters expect this number to continue to grow. When all balanced 
			out, this means that 17 million more people have insurance that would have insurance without ObamaCare. There is another part of ObamaCare that most people 
			do not know about. This other half of the Act lunches dozens of experiments in how Medicare pays doctors, trying to link the money doctors receive to whether they improve 
			patients’ health. </p>
			<h3>What is a health insurance marketplace? </h3>
			<p>Marketplaces are supposed to make it easier to shop for coverage. Before the healthcare law was passed, it was hard to compare different policies on the individual market. 
			There was no one place to browse different insurance plans and policies. Even on sites like EHealthInsurance, which included many options, it was hard to compare between different
			products. The health care law tries to make comparisons simpler by grouping all products into different metal levels: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Bronze is the simplest plan with coverage up to 60% of 
			subscribers’ bills while platinum is the best with coverage of up to 90% of bills. Once somebody picks a plan on the insurance marketplace, their enrollment file gets sent 
			electronically to the health plan, which typically collects the first month’s premium, sends out an ID card, and begins to provide coverage. In most states, the marketplace
			is Healthcare.gov. Only thirteen states plus the District of Columbia chose the other option and built their own marketplaces. </p>
			<h3>Can I buy ObamaCare right now? </h3>
			<p>One can buy insurance from Nov. 1st to Jan 31st and coverage can begin as soon as Jan 1st if you sign up before December 15th. If you want coverage to start Dec The Affordable 
			Care Act does not let people buy coverage year-round. If it did, you could imagine people signing up in the most extreme conditions like en route to the hospital which would 
			make premiums skyrocket because it would have all buying coverage at the 4exact point when they were expecting high medical bills. To prevent that, the Affordable Care Act 
			followed many other healthcare plans, and committed to a certain time frame in which you must buy your coverage. </p>

			<h3> What happens to pre-existing conditions under the Affordable Care Act?</h3>
			<p> Pre-existing conditions were an insurance industry term for different medical conditions that people already have when they’re shopping for a new plan. These could range from pretty basic 
			things (like asthma) to more serious conditions (like cancer). Before ObamaCare, health plans could deny coverage or charge higher prices to people who had these pre-existing conditions. However, under ObamaCare, the concept 
			of pre-existing conditions no longer exists. No insurance plan can reject you, charge you more, or refuse to pay for essential health benefits for any condition you had before your coverage started. Insurance companies are now 
			barred from asking questions about applicants’ health status. They can only factor in three things — age, location, and tobacco use — in setting a shopper’s premium rate. This is why insurers believe the individual mandate is 
			so important: they worry that if healthy people don’t have to buy health insurance, and if insurers can’t turn away sick people, then too many sick people and too few healthy people will sign up, which will create a budget deficit 
			for the program. Once you’re enrolled, the plan also can’t deny you coverage or raise your rates based only on your health. Additionally, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) can't refuse to cover you or 
			charge you more because of your pre-existing condition. It wasn't just health conditions that left people uninsured before Obamacare. Miners, oil drillers, and firefighters could also be denied because of their "health adverse" occupations. </p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<img src="images/pre1.png" class= "img-responsive" /> 
		 	</div>
			<div>
			<br><br>
			<h3> Pre-existing Conditions and the Mandate to Buy Insurance </h3>
			<p> The reason people were denied coverage and treatments or charged more in the past was very simple, treating sick people is expensive. The higher the risk a customer is; the worse deal it is for the insurance company to cover them. 
			Taking this into account insurance companies and legislators made a sort of deal. Health insurance companies would agree to cover everyone and give them all the same essential health benefits, but in return everyone who was able to afford
			insurance would have to buy insurance. </p>
			<p> Everyone must obtain insurance by 2014 or pay a fee. But, think about it. If no one could be denied coverage for being sick and didn’t HAVE to buy insurance, then everyone would just wait until they were sick to buy insurance. If that 
			happened, then insurance companies couldn’t afford to stay in business then no one would be able to afford healthcare. </p>

		<div> 
		<div>
			<h3> Exception: Grandfathered Plans Don’t Have to Cover Pre-Existing Conditions </h3>
			<p> Grandfathered plans don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions. If you have a grandfathered plan and want pre-existing conditions covered, you have 2 options: (1) You can switch to a Marketplace plan that will cover them during Open Enrollment 
			or (2) You can buy a Marketplace plan outside Open Enrollment when your grandfathered plan year ends, and you’ll qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. </p>

			<h3> Background </h3>
			<p> Medicaid is a joint federal and state funded program that provides health care for over 60 million low-income Americans. Before the law, Medicaid varied across the country though the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) is define US-wide—states had different 
			eligibility requirements for Medicaid based on income, age, gender, the number of dependents, and other specific requirements. Some states had or have very narrow eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which leave many working adults uninsured. For example,
			parents with two children in Illinois making up to $40,700 (185% FPL) could qualify for Medicaid but an Alabaman family with two children making up to $2,500 (11% of FPL) could not qualify. Poor working families are the most likely to not have insurance due
			to affordability. Medicaid expansion helps “cover the gap” between current Medicaid eligibility and families being able to afford private health insurance using marketplace subsidies. About half of the uninsured in America would be covered by Medicaid Expansion
			if all states opted in and joined the program. </p>

			<img src="images/Medicaid.png" class= "img-responsive" /> 
		  </div>
		  </div>
		  <br><br><br>
		  <div>
			<h3> The Law:</h3>
			<p> The law sates wanted to make more people eligible so the law continaed an expansion to everyone making beneath 138% of the 
			federal poverty line. Eligible adults are (1) Non-Working parents with incomes 38-138% of FPL, (2) Working parents with incomes 47-138% of FPL, and (3) Childless
			adults with incomes 0-138% of FPL. Starting in 2014 states that participated in Medicaid expansion increased eligibility levels for everyone in their state to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (about $16,105 for an individual and $32,913 for a family 
			of four in 2015). Even if your state didn’t expand Medicaid, you may be eligible for Marketplace subsidies if you make between 100% – 400% FPL. </p> 
			<h3>Expansion Lawsuit</h3>
			<p>However, the June 2012 Supreme Court ruling let states reject the expansion and many states with Republican governors or legislatures have done it--so now only 28 states plus D.C. expanded. Because 24 states have not expanded Medicaid, 5.7 million people
			will be uninsured in 2016. Only 54% of potentially eligible adults are aware of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Millions of Americans will be able to get care before they are forced to use costly, last-minute emergency services. The uninsured
			currently cost hospitals billions in unpaid hospitals bills – some of these costs are indirectly passed onto the average taxpayer with insurance. One of the leading causes of rising premium costs is unpaid hospital bills. The Federal Government pays 100% of 
			expansion costs for the first three years and 90% after that until 2022. Many state’s budgets have shown that expanding Medicaid raised money for the State. Cost is the most cited reason for not expanding Medicaid. While current Medicaid programs do cost state
			taxpayers a lot of money, that spending is balanced by unpaid hospital bills and the effect those bills have on the rising costs of premiums. In general, the states who opted out have the highest uninsured rates and would be the states which expansion would help 
			the most. Of course, the higher number of uninsured who qualify for Medicaid, the more it costs the state to cover them. </p>

		  <br>
			<h3> CASE STUDY: West Virginia vs New Hampshire</h3>
			<p> West Virginina, under Replican Governor Tomblin, accepted the expansion providing healthcare coverage for 150,000 more residents.
			Governor Tomblin, not only accepted the expansion because of the coverage but also because it had NO impact on the state’s budget.</p>
			<p> In 2015, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved New Hampshire to convert to a Marketplace premium assistance 
			model starting in 2016. In this model, the state obtained an authority to mandatorily enroll eligible adults in the Marketplace 
			Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) using Medicaid as the premium assistance program.  </p>

			<h4 style="color:#F8F8FF"> Okay, Ladies, Let's Get In Fomation</h4> 
		  </div>
		  <h2> Women’s Health Fact: Over half the women in the United States have avoided or delayed preventive care due to cost. </h2>
		  <div>
		  	<h3> How is the Affordable Care Act Helping Women? </h3>
		  	<p> President Obama has made it clear, “ObamaCare doesn’t regulate health care, it regulates health insurance”. ObamaCare ensures that women have access to preventive services. Providing better 
		  	preventive care for women will help to bring down the cost of insurance by preventing minor health issues from becoming major ones. This insurance reform helps to ensure that women stay healthy 
		  	and avoid preventable medical problems. Today, women can no longer be denied coverage or charged more just because of their gender. </p>
		  	<p>6.8 million women and girls selected affordable, quality health plans through the Health Insurance Marketplaces for 2016 coverage making it so between 2010 and 2015, the uninsured rate among 
		  	women ages 18 to 64 decreased from 19.3 percent to 10.8 percent, a relative reduction of 44 percent. It has also helped the estimated 55.6 million women with private health insurance have access to recommended 
		  	preventive services like mammograms or flu shots with allowing them to have no co-pay or deductible. </p>
		  	<br><br>
			<div class= "boxes">
			<img src="images/womenmore.png" class= "img-responsive" /> 
		  </div>
		  <br><br>
		  	<h3> Four Reasons Why Women LOVE their ObamaCare</h3>
		  	<p> First, as many as 65 million women with pre-existing conditions can no longer be discriminated 
		  	against or charged higher premiums for their health coverage. In the past, women could be charged more for insurance just because of their gender, and pregnancy could be defined as a pre-existing condition – resulting 
		  	in denial of coverage or exclusion from certain benefits. 
		  	<p>Secondly, an estimated 8.7 million American women with individual insurance coverage gained coverage for maternity and newborn care. About 75 percent of women 
		  	entering the workforce will experience at least one pregnancy while employed. These women and their children have access to affordable, quality medical care because under the ACA, all marketplace plans must cover maternity 
		  	and newborn care. 
		  	<p>Third, the ACA accommodates nursing moms. Research shows that support for pumping at work means nursing moms are more likely to breastfeed their children, who will have better health outcomes and spend less 
		  	time at the doctor. That means nursing moms will miss less work and be more productive. Under the ACA, most health insurance plans are required to provide breastfeeding support, equipment and counseling for pregnant and nursing
		  	 women. Plans must also pay for breast pumps for nursing mothers. 
		  	 <p>Finally, ObamaCare covers one type of birth control per person from each of 18 FDA-approved categories at no out-of-pocket cost. Contraception can cost women up to 
		  	 $600 a month out of pocket without adequate insurance. The less money you make, the more difficult it is to pay for this. The results of health service not being available to all women equally because of cost has had a great 
		  	 effect on pregnancy rates, the frequency of STDs, and a number of other related issues. </p>

		 	</div>
			  <br><br>
			<h3>Pregnancy is covered from the day your plan starts </h3>
			<p>If you’re pregnant when you apply, an insurance plan can’t reject you or charge you more because of your pregnancy. Once you’re enrolled, your pregnancy and 
			childbirth are covered from the day your plan starts. If you have a 2017 health plan & give birth or adopt after you enrolled: </p>
			<div class="boxes">
			<li> If you give birth or adopt before January 31, 2017, you can report the update on your application by logging in to report the change. </li>
			<li>If you give birth or adopt after January 31, your child’s birth or adoption will qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period. This means you can enroll in or change 
			plans outside the annual Open Enrollment Period. Your coverage can start from the date of birth or adoption, even if you enroll up to 60 days afterward. </li>
			<li>If you have a 2016 health plan & give birth or adopt in the final months of 2016: Having a baby or adopting a child qualifies you for a Special Enrollment Period so you 
			can enroll in or change plans for the rest of 2016. Your coverage can start the day of the event — even if you enroll in the plan up to 60 days afterward. </li>

			<h3>Other covered preventive services for women: </h3>
				<div class="boxes">
				<li>Breast cancer genetic test counseling (BRCA) for women at higher risk
				<li>Breast cancer mammography screenings every 1 to 2 years for women over 40
				<li>Breast cancer chemoprevention counseling for women at higher risk

		  <div>
		  	<h2> With the incoming President-Elect, many are wondering what will happen to the Affordable Care Act.</h2> 
			<h3>Opinion Pieces</h3>
			<p> One of my favor pieces about keeping ObamaCare is titled "317 million Reasons to Keep ObamaCare". In this piece, CNN contributor
			Sally Kohn writes "There are millions more reasons to celebrate Obamacare. Actually, at the writing of this essay, there are more than 317 million reasons — because
			 that's the population of the United States of America and every single one of us can benefit from health care reform." She goes on to list these numbers:
			 <div class="boxes">
			 <li>3.1 million: That's how many young adults can get coverage because of the provision in Obamacare that allows them to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.
			 <li>105 million: That's how many Americans no longer have lifetime expense caps, whether it's because they have chronic illnesses or because their insurance company set restrictive policies.
			 <li>6.1 million: That's how many Americans with Medicare Part D no longer have to go through the "doughnut hole" coverage gap. This means seniors can save more than $5.7 billion on prescription drugs.
			 <li >3.2 million: That's the number of small businesses estimated to be eligible for tax credits for providing health insurance to their 19.3 million employees nationwide, credits worth $15.4 billion in 2011 alone.
			 <li>4.4 million: That's how many low-income adults will now have access to health insurance thanks to states implementing the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare; an additional 5.8 million poor adults 
			 would be included in this count if 25 mostly Republican-led states weren't refusing Medicaid expansion.
  			 <li>50 to 129 million: That's how many people will benefit from the Obamacare provision that eliminates all bars for coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Studies say that anywhere from 19% to 50% of non-elderly 
  			 Americans have health conditions that could qualify as pre-existing conditions.
 			 <li >49.4 million: That's how many current Medicare enrollees can feel secure knowing that, under Obamacare, existing Medicare benefits can neither be reduced nor taken away.
			 <li>317 million: That's how many Americans — i.e., all of us — potentially benefit from the requirement that insurance companies provide flu shots, HIV screenings, prostate exams, mammograms and FDA-approved 
			 contraception for free, without a co-pay. Plus, we all benefit from new requirements that insurance companies must spend at least 80% of our premium dollars on our health care as opposed to marketing or administration. </li>

		  	<h3>The Facts</h3>
		  	<p> As stated by Former Representative Bill Owens of New York, "The chaos that would ensue in the healthcare system by repealing ObamaCare is largely unimaginable, and I suspect not at all thought through by proponents of repeal legislation". 
		  	<p> The fact are if Congress and the President-Elect repeal the ACA:
			<div class="boxes">
		  	<li> 20 million people will automatically lose their healthcare.
		  	<li> Fifty million – one out of every six of us – will go back to being uninsured.
		  	<li> Undoing Obamacare would undo a lot of taxes at the top, and a lot of subsidies at the bottom. 
		  	<li> Those with pre-existing conditions (EVEN BEING A WOMAN) would go back to being at the mercy of insurance companies.
		  	<li> There would no longer be a requirement that companies with at least 50 full-time employees provide health care coverage.
		  	<li> Those under 26, now able to stay on their parents' plan, will be in limbo with University healthcare plans or stuck with no healthcare.
		  	<li> The US would go back to spending around 18 percent of our GDP on health care expenses.
		  	<li> There would be a 47% increase in costs for consumers who buy insurance individually.
		  	</li> </div> <br>
			<p> It is imperative that those who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act have a plan because there is no way to simply take away 17 million people's healthcare, plus take away the extended coverage provided by the ACA for many more millions 
		  	of people. It is almost improbable to happen. If the President-Elect and Congress think that there is too much dislike sent their way right now, if they take away 17million+ people's healthcare, they better be prepared for riots. Where do those 
		  	who lose coverage go for care? As you might have guessed, it is your local hospital emergency room. This will result in tens of billions of dollars in uncompensated care being provided by our hospitals. Prior to the enactment of ObamaCare, 
		  	uncompensated care provided by hospitals in our communities was in the range of $75 billion to $125 billion. Would physicians continue to treat people who they knew had no coverage and no likelihood of being able to pay?  if young adults ages 
		  	18 to 26 lose coverage, as well as those with pre-existing conditions, where do those who lose coverage go for care?</p>

			<h3> There are too many question unanswered for the Congress and President Elect to go ahead and repeal the ACA without having a detailed and fully thoughtout plan to replace it. Yes, the ACA is not a perfect law, but let's try to fix it before kicking 20 million people off healthcare. </h3>
